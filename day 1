Day 1
Just starting r learning, here are the codes I just leanrt 
1. Remeber to impor the library before importing the data 

ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
  
  Here are some ways to distiguish the shapes in the plots
 This is formula for facet wrap
 
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
  A continuous variable can not be mapped to linetype
  
  I don't quite understand this part:
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
    
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
  
  I just found something on Stackoverflow:
  "se = False" stands for std error of the estimate
  
  This will produce a smooth line that assemble all of the points that is being displayed in the chart 
  ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
